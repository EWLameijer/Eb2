GENERAL:
ONLY 10 min on working days, until time paid back (8u+12 min!) Niet tot ik die 1659 min heb ingehaald :!


What works:
[MENU]
    File =>
        Create Deck
        Load Deck
        Restore from Archive
        Quit. SHORTCUT DOESN'T WORK, CTRL-Q DOES

    Manage Deck =>
        Add Card
        Study Options
        Deck Archiving Options


[REVIEWING MODE]
    Remembered
    Forgotten
    Show Answer
    Edit Card
    Delete Card

[Review Summary]
    Back to information screen
    Go to next round

TODO
? In summary screen: Review now add R mnemonic?
?         for (i in spans.indices)  textBlockHeight = spans[i] can be simpler?
? TimeInputElememt : remove companion object
? retest everything?
? invest time in automatic testing?

After: self-check (redundancies, comments)

BUGS:
8/12/18 Back to information screen: button works, mnemonic doesn't. Accidentally uppercase mnemonic...
8/12/18 Delete Card: does not work properly. Fixed, indices-loop 'improvements' kind of sucked...
8/12/18 Quit. SHORTCUT DOESN'T WORK, clicking the window DOES. Added a "System.exit() to the called function"
8/12/18 Edit Card: shows add card, with empty contents. Made simpler 'source of truth' by delegating the getting of the card
    to ReviewManager






!!! When this works again, commit on Github, then at every 15 mins work (okay, 2x10) commit until entire codebase
!!! sufficiently cleaned

STYLE
IF same over lifetime object, can be read but not written to: val
IF can change and straightforward to write to (writing is never illegal if type is correct) var
ELSE function

INFO: Number of reviewable cards is 0
